rumpetgo is a Go back-end for Rumpetroll.  It implements the basic
functionality: relaying of movement updates and messages between clients.

Try it out (you must have Go installed, see http://golang.org/):
  git clone http://github.com/nf/Rumpetroll.git
  cd Rumpetroll/go
  gomake
  ./rumpetgo
and load http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

Captivated by Rumpetroll's brilliantly simple concept, I wrote this as an
exercise to see how one might build its back-end in Go.

The Ruby back-end uses channels and an event-driven approach, so it's similar
in some ways. It would be interesting to see a comparison of performance
numbers.

I made some small modifications to the front-end code to make the Go side
simpler, but were I doing it from scratch I could further simplify both sides.

Kudos to the Rumpetroll guys for producing such a great program and for
releasing the code! :-)
